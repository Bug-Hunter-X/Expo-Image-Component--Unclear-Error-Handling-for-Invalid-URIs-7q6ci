This bug occurs when using the Expo `Image` component with a URI that is not properly formatted or points to a non-existent resource.  This can lead to an error that's difficult to track down because the error messages aren't always clear.  For example, using a URI with a typo or pointing to an image that has been removed or renamed will result in the image not rendering and potentially causing other unexpected behavior in the application.
